# MAIN-video-selector
Multilanguage video boot selector fo OGXbox

the tool is made up of an installer (to be used only the first time) and the application itself. 
the installer can be used in folder format or from dvd by burning the iso. the version for "unedited ini" points to the C:\bootanims\Xbox folder, the one for "edited ini" to the C:\bootanims\Xmv Player folder.

It is possible to load custom videos by placing them in the Custom folder contained in the main directory of the program inside the Video path. 
Custom videos must be named as "Video1", "Video2", "Video3", etc. up to 10

here you can find a ready-to-install version: https://mega.nz/folder/Fw43EK6T#5aefTyT2JD4lvvKuMdsPrw
