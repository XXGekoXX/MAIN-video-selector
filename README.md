# MAIN-video-selector
Multilanguage video boot selector fo OGXbox

the tool is made up of an installer (to be used only the first time) and the application itself. 
the installer can be used in folder format or from dvd by burning the iso. the version for "unedited ini" points to the C:\bootanims\Xbox folder, the one for "edited ini" to the C:\bootanims\Xmv Player folder.

It is possible to load custom videos by placing them in the Custom folder contained in the main directory of the program inside the Video path. 
Custom videos must be named as "Video1", "Video2", "Video3", etc. up to 10

here you can find a ready-to-install version: https://mega.nz/folder/Fw43EK6T#5aefTyT2JD4lvvKuMdsPrw

The work you find on this page is the result of a lot of passion and a lot of time dedicated to the old and dear Xbox original, I did not invent anything because I simply have together different notions found on the net and everything I did is simply to safeguard my console and my legally owned games. I AM AGAINST ANY FORM OF PIRACY AND I DO NOT WANT TO FACILITATE IT IN ANY WAY, therefore if this is your goal, please change page
